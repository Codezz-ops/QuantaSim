# Installation
    To use Qsim in your own project, simply include the qsim.h header file in your code, and link against the qsim library.

    Qsim has several third-party library dependencies, including the math library and the PNG library. You will need to have these libraries installed on your system to build Qsim.

    To build Qsim, run the following commands:

    ```
    cd build 
    cmake ..
    make 
    ```

    This will build the qsim library and install it to the system-wide library directory.
