# Qsim: A Physics Simulation Engine

Qsim is a C library for building physics simulations. It provides functionality for creating and simulating particles, applying forces to them, and detecting collisions between them. The library is designed to be fast, efficient, and flexible, allowing users to create a wide range of physics simulations.

## Features

    Particle simulation: Qsim provides a particle struct that represents a particle in a physics simulation. Users can create particles, set their initial positions and velocities, and apply forces to them to simulate their motion.

    Force functions: Qsim provides a number of force functions that can be applied to particles. These include gravitational forces, electromagnetic forces, and custom user-defined forces.

    Collision detection: Qsim provides collision detection functions that can detect when particles collide with each other or with other objects in the simulation.

    Flexibility: Qsim is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to create custom force functions, collision detection functions, and other functionality to suit their specific needs.
